# AI-DOT-BOT

Artificial Intelligence Driven Options Trading Bot incorporates highly developed deep learning models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (Long Short-Term Memory or LSTM) to accurately predict closing prices of options contracts. It features many advanced techniques and optimizations, including:

- **Adam Optimizer**: For efficient and adaptive learning rates.
- **StandardScaler**: To normalize features for improved model performance.
- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Activation Function**: For non-linear transformations and handling the vanishing gradient problem.
- **L1 & L2 Regularizers**: To prevent overfitting by adding penalties on layer parameters.
- **Reduce LR On Plateau**: For dynamic learning rate adjustment when a metric stops improving.
- **Early Stopping Techniques**: To halt training when performance stops improving to prevent overfitting.

### Features and Enhancements:
- **Advanced Model Architectures**: Incorporates both ANN and LSTM for robust prediction capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Preprocessing**: Data normalization and noise reduction for clean input data.
- **Extensive Performance Metrics**: Including Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluation.
- **Visualizations for Analysis**: Various plots and graphs for deep insights into model performance and predictions.

### Visual Results and Analysis:
1. **Line Plot and Box Plot after Preprocessing**: These plots help in visualizing the variation in data and identifying any noise present. They provide a clear understanding of data distribution and outliers.
